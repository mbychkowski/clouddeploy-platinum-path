Article on Medium: https://medium.com/@palladiusbonton/draft-canarying-on-gcp-with-cloud-deploy-91b3e4d0ee9a

This repo tries to demo a few applications (under `apps/`) and it's path to
deployment via Google Cloud Platform's `Cloud Build` + `Cloud Deploy`.
Since a lot of setup is needed, I took inspiration from `[willisc7](https://github.com/willisc7)`'s
[Gold Path repo](https://github.com/willisc7/next21-demo-golden-path).

I've tried to simplify the app and the `skaffold` part and concentrated on
automating the installation of Service Accounts, clusters, etc. all in
single scripts with a catchy name.

Note that EVERYTHING is automated except linking the external repo to Cloud
Build (this is currently possible in Alpha API which requires whitelisting).
All the shell scripts you see in the main directory have been
extensively tested, all the experimental code is under
[examples/](https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/tree/main/examples).

**This is _NOT_ an officially supported Google product.**

## High-level architecture

<img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/Ricc%20Canary%20deployment%202022.png" alt="Architecture v1.1" align='right' />

## Setting things up

All scripts in the root directory are named in numerical order and describe the outcome they‚Äôre intended to achieve.

Before executing any bash script, they all source a `.env.sh` script which you‚Äôre supposed to create (from the
`.env.sh.dist` (file) and maintain somewhere else (I personally created and use
[git-privatize](https://github.com/palladius/sakura/blob/master/bin/git-privatize)
and symlink it from/to another private repo).

1. Choose your environment.
    * You can use Google [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) üñ•Ô∏è (leveraging the awesome integrated editor).
      This code has been fully tested there.
    * **Linux** machine where you‚Äôve installed `gcloud`.
    * **Max OSX** with bash v5 or more (to support hashes). To do so, just try `brew install bash` and make sure to use
      the new BASH path ~(you might have to explicitly call the scripts with `bash SCRIPTNAME.sh`).

2. [Fork](https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/fork) the code repo:
    * Go to https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/
    * Click ‚Äú**Fork‚Äù** to fork the code under your username.

    <img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/github-fork.png?raw=true" alt="GitHub Fork" align='center' />

   * New URL will look like this: https://github.com/daenerys/clouddeploy-platinum-path [with your username].
     You‚Äôll need this username in a minute.
   * **__Note__** that if you don‚Äôt have a github account (and you don‚Äôt want to create one), you can just fork my repo in your
     GCR - more instructions later at step (6) below.
   * To connect your github repo, follow instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/github/build-repos-from-github
   * Open **Cloud Developer Console** > **Cloud Build** > **Triggers**: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers
   * Click on **Connect repository** button (bottom of page):

    <img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/cloudbuild-connect-repo.png?raw=true" alt="Connect Repository on Cloud Build" align='center' />

    * ‚ÄúSelect Source‚Äù > ‚Äú**GitHub (Cloud Build GitHub App)**‚Äù and click ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù.

3. *[Totally optional]* Install a colorizing gem. If you won‚Äôt do it, there‚Äôs a `lolcat` fake wrapper in `bin/` (added to
   path in init script). But trust me, it‚Äôs worth it (unless you have no Ruby installed).

    `gem install lolcat`


4. Copy the env template to a new file that we‚Äôll modify

    `cp .env.sh.dist .env.sh`

5. Open `.env.sh` and substitute the proper values for any variable that has # changeme next to it.
  (If you‚Äôre on üñ•Ô∏è **Cloud Shell**, you can try `edit .env.sh` üòé to let the UI editor shine). For instance:

    * **PROJECT_ID**. This your string (non-numeric) project id -
      [More info](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).
    * **ACCOUNT** (eg, john.snow.kotn@gmail.com). This is the email address of your GCP identity (who you authenticate
      with). Note that you can also set up a service account, but that‚Äôs not covered by this demo. In this case I‚Äôll leave
      it with you to tweak the 00-init.sh script. On üñ•Ô∏è Cloud Shell, it's already set and you can get it from
      `gcloud config get account`.
    * **GCLOUD_REGION**. This is the region where 90% of things will happen. Please do choose a region with more
      capacity (my rule of thumb is to choose the oldest region in your geo, like us-central1, europe-west1, ‚Ä¶).
      If unsure, pick our favorite: us-central1.
    * **GITHUB_REPO_OWNER** (eg, *‚Äúdaenerys‚Äù*). This should be the user you forked the repo with in step (2). You can
      find it also in `$ grep clouddeploy-platinum-path .git/config`

Optional fields:


* **GCLOUD_CONFIG** [optional]. This is the name of your gcloud configuration. Pretty cosmetic, it becomes important
  when you have a lot of users/projects for different projects and you want to
  üìΩÔ∏è [keep them separated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jOk8dk-qaU). Try
  `gcloud config configurations list` to see your local environment. While not needed, I consider it a good practice to
  isolate your configs into gcloud configs.

* **MY_DOMAIN** [optional]. This is totally optional. Setting up [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns)
  is very provider-dependent. If you have Cloud DNS already set up, you can be inspired by my script in
  `examples/14-setup-DNS-Riccardo-only.sh` and tweak it to your liking.


6. Tip (*optional*): If you want to persist your personal `.env.sh`, consider using my script `git-privatize`. If  you
   find a better way, please tell me - as I‚Äôve looked for the past 5 years and this is the best I came up with.

### First - a note on my scripts

The root directory of my repo has a number of bash scripts which could discourage most of you. A few technical and philosophical notes:
* Scripts must be run in alpha order from `00-XXX.sh` to `16-YYY.sh`.
* Every script is ‚Äútransactional‚Äù, meaning if fails at first non-0 exit of a subcommand (this is achieved by `set -e`
  plus `bin/proceed_if_error_matches` for which I've been nominated for a Pulitzer). At the end of the script, a common
  routine will touch a file called `.executed_ok.04-status.sh.touch`. This will leave a breadcrumb trail which tells
  you where the script failed:

  <img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/breadcrumbs-screenshot.png?raw=true" alt="Carlessian Breadcrumbs" align='center' />

* Everything in this is scripted except one point which requires manual intervention between step 6 and step 7, which
  is why I called the manual intervention 6.5 which I then moved at the beginning of the instructions (so now it looks
  more lie 0.065).

### Scripts from 1 to 16

0. `00-init.sh`. **Initialization**

  This scripts parses the ENV vars in env.sh and sets your GCLOUD, SKAFFOLD and GKE environment for
  success. If you leave this project, do something else with gcloud or GKE and come back to it tomorrow, its always safe
  to execute it once or even twice.

    üêßricc@derek:~/clouddeploy-platinum-path$ ./00-init.sh

1. (`./01-set-up-GKE-clusters.sh`).  **Setting up GKE clusters**

  This script sets up 3 autopilot clusters:

* cicd-noauto-canary. It will contain canary workloads (pre-prod)
* cicd-noauto-prod. It will contain production workloads.
* cicd-noauto-dev. It will contain everything else (dev, staging, and my tests). It will also be the *default* cluster.

Note:  Cluster Build can take several minutes to complete. You can check progress by viewing the
`Kubernetes Engine` -> `Kubernetes clusters` screen, or just have a ‚òï.


2. `./02-setup-skaffold-cache-bucket.sh` **Setup GCS + Skaffold Cache**.

   This script creates a bucket which we'll use as Skaffold
   Cache. This will make your Cloud Builds super-fast! Thanks Alex the tip!



3. `03-configure-artifact-repo-and-docker.sh`. ***Set up Artifact Repository and docker/k8s***.
4. *`04-status.sh`*. Convenience script to show status of the installation.
5. 05-IAM-enable-cloud-build.sh
6. `06-WIP-automated-cloud-build-setup.sh`. You can safely skip this.
7. `07-create-cloud-build-triggers.sh`. **Note** this script will fail if you didn't connect the repository as per
   instructions. This complicated script sets up Cloud Build for a number of apps, where I subsumed the "parameter" part
   in a Bash array (kudos for the courage). This configuration tells Cloud Build: Where to look for code, how to name
   the trigger, plus a number of less useful parameters.

```bash
# üìò excerpt from File: `04-status.sh`
TEAMS[0]='T1py;app01;cloudbuild.yaml;apps/app01/;blue'
TEAMS[1]='T2rb;app02;cloudbuild.yaml;apps/app02/;green'
```



8. `08-cloud-deploy-setup.sh`  **Create Cloud Deploy Infrastructure**. This sets up `clouddeploy.yaml` and creates:
two identical Delivery Pipelines for app01 and app02, plus a different pipeline for app03.

* For each pipeline, it creates four targets: **dev**, **staging**, **canary** (or **canary-prod** for app03) and **prod**.
* The slight complication here is that Cloud Deploy doesn‚Äôt support ‚Äúhydration‚Äù of the YAML so we need to do it manually:
    * Look at clouddeploy.template.yaml
    * See how the bash script sed‚Äôs variables like `MY_PROJECT_ID`, `MY_REGION`, `_MY_VERSION_` to variables
      set up by script.


**üß™Testing the solution: trigger Build apps**

Now you can bump the version file of one or two apps and you should see the build making it into DEV and STAGING after
a couple of minutes, as in this screenshot:

<img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/promo-dev-staging.png?raw=true"
 alt="Simple Promotion to Dev and Staging" align='center' />


```bash
source .env.sh # so you can use GITHUB_REPO_OWNER and other convenience vars.
git remote add $GITHUB_REPO_OWNER git@github.com:$GITHUB_REPO_OWNER/clouddeploy-platinum-path.git
echo 2.99test > ./apps/app01/VERSION # or whichever version it is plus one
echo 2.99test > ./apps/app02/VERSION # or whichever version it is plus one
git add ./apps/app01/VERSION
git add ./apps/app02/VERSION
git commit -m ‚Äòbump version‚Äô
git push $GITHUB_REPO_OWNER main
```

**üß™Testing the solution: skaffold dev cycle** [optional]

**_Note_**: This was a very *Eureka* moment to me - although not strictly needed. This where you see all the power of
*skaffold*: you enter in an infinite dev loop where you change the code and its changes get built and pushed to GKE
as you code. Some code changes don‚Äôt even need a rebuild - but directly ‚Äúscp‚Äù the changed file to prod via
[File Sync](https://skaffold.dev/docs/pipeline-stages/filesync/), my favorite skaffold feature.

Let‚Äôs now go into the first repo and try to leverage Skaffold for editing code and seeing its changes deployed to GKE (!).

```bash
$ cd apps/app01/
$ make dev
# I‚Äôm lazy and I assume you're lazy too. This command is the equivalent of:
# ricc@zurisack:üè°$ skaffold --default-repo ‚Äú$SKAFFOLD_DEFAULT_REPO‚Äù dev
```

If the app compiles properly, this should issue a code push to Artifact Repository.

Plus, Skaffold should push your code to the k8s manifests as described in `skaffold.yaml` (in our cases this is
`./k8s/_base`, hence `kustomize`). **Note** If you use *autopilot* clusters, you might encounter quota issues, until the cluster
scales up to accommodate your new needs (which is why I removed autopilot by default).

Notice that you can leverage the FILE SYNC for your app to make sure only big change force a full rebuild. For instance,
my ruby apps take long to `Docker`ize, so to me it‚Äôs a killer feature that a small change to `main.rb` gets directly
pushed into the living container, while a change to `Gemfile` needs to force a full clean build.


9.  `09-show-latest-successful-releases.sh` This is a convenience script I wrote to tell me what was the last successful
   release for an app.

```bash
$ ./09-show-latest-successful-releases.sh app01
$ ./09-show-latest-successful-releases.sh app02
# or for both:
$ make show-latest-succesful-releases
```

The culprit of the code is here:

```bash
gcloud deploy releases list --delivery-pipeline "$PIPELINE" \
  --filter renderState=SUCCEEDED \
  --format="value(name.split())" \
  --sort-by=~createTime --limit 1 |
    cut -d';' -f 8
```

10. `10-auto-promote-APP_XX-STAGE_YY-to-STAGE_ZZ.sh`. This is another convenience script which i've created for YOU.

**Note**. Scripts from now on (10 and up) will fail miserably if you didn't successfully issue a Build Trigger via UI
or CLI as in the 08 lab. Make sure that Cloud Deploy has version deployed in Dev/Staging before proceeding. The easiest
way is to check at this link: https://console.cloud.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines

```bash
üêß$ ./10-auto-promote-APP_XX-STAGE_YY-to-STAGE_ZZ.sh <APP_ID> <TARGET_FROM> <TARGET_TO>
```

**Note** this script is just myself hitting my head around Cloud Deploy and doing CLI promotion. You can do it with a
simple click in the UI and maybe that‚Äôs what you should do the first 1-2 times.
When you are familiar with it, you can use this ‚Äúswiss army knife script‚Äù to promote an app from a target to another.
I spent some time learning how to auto detect the latest release (hard) and then how to promote (easy).
The code is now in this script. For example, you can try to do first (it will pick up some reasonable defaults):

**üß™Testing the solution: promote to Canary and Prod**

The previous result (invoking the script with NO args) should be useless, as promote DEV to STAGE has already happened.
Try now this:

```bash
$ ./10-auto-promote-APP_XX-STAGE_YY-to-STAGE_ZZ.sh app01 staging canary
```

This should promote the release from second to third target, look:

<img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/promote-to-canary.png?raw=true"
 alt="Promotion from Staging to Canary (CLI)" align='center' />

.. and it works!

So this script should be your swiss army knife for promoting the latest release for appXX from any target to any target (I haven‚Äôt tested bad directions, like 2 to 4 or 3 to 2: you should only be doing from N to N+1).

For the second promotion, we will use the **UI** as it‚Äôs beautiful:
* Open the browser at: https://console.cloud.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines
* Click on *App01*. You should see the first 3 stages with a green color, while no rollouts associated to prod.
* Click **Promote** here:

<img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/promote-canary-prod-ui.png?raw=true"
 alt="Promotion from Canary to Prod (UI)" align='center' />

 * Fill in a rollout description (eg "I follow riccardo README suggestions"), so you can laugh at yourself when it
   breaks in the future :)

* I really love the UI since it brings a lot of contextual data:
    * First a rollout comment, useful in the future
    * Second, a manifest diff so you can see what you‚Äôre really changing. This is NOT available for the very first
      rollout, but comes interesting from the second on. It links error to right contextual logs. So every error is
      one click away to investigate the issue.

11.  *redacted*
12.  *redacted*
13.  *redacted*
14.  *redacted*
15.  `15-solution2-xlb-GFE3-traffic-split.sh` **Set up traffic split (solution 2!)**

This is how NEGs will look for your two endpoints. The "healthy" column will help you torubleshoot it all.

<img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/app02-sol2-svc-canaryprod-neg-view.png?raw=true" alt="Solution 2 NEG view on GCP GCLB page" align='center' />


16. `16-solution2-test-by-curling-N-times.sh`. Once you set up the traffic splitting "infrastructure", this script
    will simply do a `kubectl down` and `kubectl up` and test the setup.



## Other great scripts

I've disseminated `bin/` with scripts that I utilized for testing my solutions. You might find them useful (and send me
a PR to fix the errors ). Some examples:

    üêßricc@derek:$ bin/curl-them-all

<img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/curl-them-all-screenshot.png?raw=true" alt="curl-them-all script example" align='center' />


## Express Install

* Make sure you did the mirrot github repo and your github user is in your env.sh.
* Do steps 1,2,3,4,5,6 automatically: `make first-half` (should ~always work)
* Do steps 7,8,9,..,16 automatically - `make second-half` (can fail if you made mistake in the mirror repo setup)

You should be good to go!

Note: Some scripts in here can all be found
in my [Swiss-Army Knife repo](https://github.com/palladius/sakura/), but the ones needed
for this are all under `bin/`.

## The apps

The app part is really the NON-interesting part here. I tried to keep it as simple as
possible. You can complicate it as long as you have a Dockerfile or a Buildpack
to build it.

* `apps/app01/` This is a sample üêç *Python* app.
* `apps/app02/` This is a sample üíé *Ruby* app.
* `apps/app03/` This is a sample üßä *Node.js* app.

<img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/3apps.png?raw=true" alt="Three Apps" align='center' />

They both expose a single Web page (`/`) with a lot of debug useful information, usually
surfaced by proper ENV vars. They also expose a second convenience endpoint (`/statusz`)
with a one-liner description (used by scripts), such as:

```
app=app01 version=2.23 target=prod emoji=üêç
app=app01 version=2.22 target=canary emoji=üêç
[..]
app=app02 version=2.0.6 target=prod emoji=üíé
app=app02 version=2.0.7 target=canary emoji=üíé
[..]
app=app03 version=1.0.2 target=prod emoji=üßä
app=app03 version=1.0.3 target=canary emoji=üßä
```

<img src="https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/blob/main/doc/canary-horizontal-render.gif?raw=true" alt="Terminal Demo" align='center' />

## Build philosophy

* Every commit to `main` will trigger a Cloud Build, provided code is in some `apps/appXX/` . In particular, any change to the code to app01 will trigger a build in the APP01 pipeline, and so on. **Yes**, it's that beautiful.

* Promotion DEV -> STAGING. This is a second BUILD which also executes `make test` in the
`app/MYAPP` folder.

* *For picky people*. Note that in the real world, the promotion from DEV to STAGING wouldn't happen after Unit Tests (rather integration tests), but for this demo I wanted as many releases out as possible with minimal manual intervention, so I did it this way. In a real scenario, a failed `make test` would prevent the DEV release altogether.

## Deploy philosophy

4 targets have been created:

1. **dev**. Every successful commit lands here. Deploys to **dev** GKE cluster.
1. **staging**. Also deploys to **dev** GKE cluster.
1. **canary** *OR* **canary-production** (depends on app, see below). A release in this state will get a small
  percentage of traffic.
2. **production**. A release in this state will get *most* traffic. Deploys to **prod** GKE cluster.

Note on apps and third stage (*canary**):

* **App01**üêç and **App02**üíé have **canary** as 3rd stage, which pushes to a **canary** GKE cluster.
  This has been done to demonstrate a complex, multi-cluster case.
* **App03**üßä been configured differently with **canary-production** as 3rd stage , with Canary and Production stages
  *both* pushing to **prod** GKE cluster. This has been done to demonstrate a simpler use case.

Confused? Look at this graph:

## Canary solutions

Historically, 3 solutions have been provided. History is important since it plays a role
into script numbering and ordering ;) which was hard to change. A fourth solution has been added in July 22.

* ‚ùå ~~Solution0: ILB + TrafficSplitting. Doesnt have public IP.~~ [Initial code (script 11)](https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/pull/3/files)
* ‚ùå ~~Solution1: Global XLB + Gateway API + Pod splitting.~~
* ‚úÖ **Solution2**: Envoy-based GXLB + Gateway API +proper Traffic Splitting (**complex solution**) (for `app01` and `app02`).
* ‚ùå ~~Solution3: *symlink* to solution0~~
* ‚úÖ **Solution4** (**simple solution**): single-cluster Pod Splitting (`app03`).

More info on historical code under `k8s/amarcord/` (Romagnolo Italian for *I remember*, plus a
[memorable movie by Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarcord)).

*(GXLB: Global eXternal Load Balancer)*

### Simple solution: single-cluster pod-splitting (üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢üü°) thru k8s service

*(formerly known as: Solution 4)*

TODO(ricc): solution 4 image (missing but already linked as `doc/solution4.png`)

### Complex solution: multi-cluster traffic-splitting canarying through Gateway API , envoy-backed ‚öñÔ∏è XLB and ü™° lot of weaving

*(formerly known as: Solution 2)*

This is what you'll see when you get this to work:

## Lesson learnt

* Never EVER change name of entities, particularly if they are pointed by different products/modules.
  for instance, the Artifact Repository, or the Image name. Image version is a no-breezer, but remember
  that changing the code in your manifest doesn't mean that the deployer is aware of the change because
  its configuration "online" is based on a 1-month-old manifest which pointed to the earliest version.
  If you do, destroying everything and rebuilding seems the only safe choice, and since I don't want it
  I suggest you: don't change the NAMES, change just everything else :)
* As a corollary, when you name a resource, make sure you spend **time** to add the right dimensions: is it
  function of APPNAME? If yes, it should have APPNAMe inside the name (like "appo1-frontend"). Is it
  regional? If yes, then make sure some sort of region string is in the name so you can have the US and EU
  version of it, and so on.


## Possible errors

* gcloud crashed (AttributeError): 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'SelfLink' => See
  [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57031471/gcloud-crashed-attributeerror-nonetype-object-has-no-attribute-revisiontem)

* Some Org policies might prevent you from achieving your goal. For instance, a `constraints/compute.vmExternalIp`
  policy would prevent your GKE clusters to be set up with public IPs. Feel free to file a PR to fix this which is
  beyond the scope of this demo.
