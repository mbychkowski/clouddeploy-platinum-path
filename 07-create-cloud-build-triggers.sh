TRIGGERVERSION="1-8"
# 1.8  20220819 Only pushes on MAIN branch, as suggested by bielski.
# 1.7  20220708 Changed colors cos Ruby is Red and Python is green, but more importantly I dont want to confuse people with blue/green deployment since app_id is orthogonal to deployment stage.
# 1.6  20220610 Added 'cloud-build/**' to trigger changes.
# 1.5b 20220603 I didnt change a thing but DESTROYED everything since i had 4 triggers, 2 in 1.5a and 2 in 1.3 so wanted to have a clean slate.
# 1.5a          ????
# 1.4           Added DEPLOY_REGION as per CD necessity.
# 1.3           Made from regional to GLOBAL (local have QUOTA issues) #important
# 1.2           Made better substitutions.
